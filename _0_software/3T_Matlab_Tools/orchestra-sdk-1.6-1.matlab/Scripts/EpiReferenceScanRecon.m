%   [ phaseCorrectionHandle, nextDabPacketIndex ] = EpiReferenceScanRecon(archiveHandle, rowFlipHandle, plotAppliedCoefficients)
%   Computes EPI phase correction coefficients from the given scan archive.
%   A phase correction handle is returned which contains the computed
%   coefficients. The next dab packet index in the scan archive is also
%   returned. This is useful for archives which contain an integrated
%   reference acquisition. For these archives, reconstruction can continue
%   from the dab packet index that the reference processing stopped at.
%   An archiveHandle containing the data to compute coefficients from is 
%   required. An archiveHandle is required rather than a ScanArchive path
%   to support the case of integrated reference scan in which the archive
%   is opened by a parent Epi recon script which calls this function to
%   compute coefficients from a portion of the data in the archive.
%   A row flip handle is required to apply the EPI row flip prior to
%   computing coefficients from the reference data. Similar to the
%   archiveHandle, a handle is required here because this allows a parent
%   script to open the row flip handle and share it with this script.
%   An optional plotAppliedCoefficients parameter may be supplied to 
%   control whether the computed coefficients are applied to the original 
%   row-flipped reference data and plotted. Applying the coefficients to 
%   the reference data is not required for recon, but is useful to 
%   demonstrate the effect that the coefficients have.
